## General Rules

Detector asks for a set of unverified transactions from bank.
For each transaction, detector validates following 
* Sender is the owner of the sender account
* Sender has no warrants issued.
* Sender has a valid contract.

Once detector validates the transaction, it should tell the bank if the transactions is valid or not.
Bank tracks which transactions it has given to detector and tracks if detector takes too long to validate.
Bank will never issue an outdated transaction.
